# CouncilInsight Implementation Plan for Oak Bay

## Project Overview

CouncilInsight is a municipal meeting intelligence platform that can help Oak Bay improve governance transparency, citizen engagement, and administrative efficiency by automatically capturing, analyzing, and making searchable all council meeting content.

## Oak Bay-Specific Integration Strategy

Based on the Oak Bay website analysis, we can see they're using a modern engagement platform (Connect Oak Bay) powered by Social Pinpoint technology. This gives us several advantages for integration:

1. **Modern Web Architecture**: The site uses modern JavaScript frameworks and responsive design
2. **Existing Project Structure**: They already categorize municipal initiatives by topic and department
3. **Community Engagement Focus**: The platform is clearly designed for resident feedback

### Integration Touchpoints

1. **Authentication System**: Leverage existing user accounts from Connect Oak Bay
2. **Visual Design**: Match the existing Oak Bay branding and UI patterns
3. **Data Categories**: Align with their existing categorization system:
   - Active Transportation
   - Budget
   - Capital Projects
   - Community Planning
   - Council Priorities
   - Fire and Emergency Management
   - Parks & Facilities
   - Public Works
   - Recreation

4. **Geographic Areas**: Support their neighborhood divisions:
   - North Oak Bay
   - Central Oak Bay (incl. Oak Bay Village)
   - South Oak Bay
