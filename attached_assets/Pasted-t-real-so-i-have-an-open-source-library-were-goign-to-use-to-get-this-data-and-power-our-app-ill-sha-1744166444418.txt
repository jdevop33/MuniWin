Regular Meetings Dates and Times
Council meetings are generally held in our Council Chambers at Oak Bay Municipal Hall (2167 Oak Bay Avenue) on the second and fourth Monday of the month; Committee of the Whole also meets in Council Chambers,  typically on the third Monday.  Our schedule does change in September, October, and December, so please check the meeting schedule below for specific dates during these months. No regular meetings are scheduled during August, or during the month of a General Local Election.

Most meetings start at 7:00 PM for regular business; however meeting times may change – visit our CivicWeb Portal to view Council meeting dates and start times. In the event that an In Camera session is required, the Council meeting will commence at 6:00 PM with a motion to adjourn to In Camera taking place immediately. The regular Council meeting will then reconvene at 7:00 PM. Although you are welcome to join us for the In Camera motion, members of the public will be asked to leave the chambers during In Camera deliberations.

In Camera Sessions
Council is only authorized to hold In Camera meetings under the circumstances set out in Section 90 of the Community Charter. These meetings are closed to the public and meetings are held to discuss and make decisions on matters pertaining to personnel, land, labour or employee negotiations, law enforcement, litigation or potential litigation and information that is prohibited from disclosure under the Freedom of Information and Protective of Privacy Act.  In Camera Sessions generally commence at 6:00 PM, in advance of regular Council meetings.

Committee of the Whole
When sitting as Committee of the Whole, members of Council are seated in a round-table set up for a less formal setting. These meetings provide a forum in which Council receives presentations from applicants and staff on items requiring more in-depth explanation, discussion and Council feedback. Most meetings are held on the third Monday of the month at 7:00 PM in Council Chambers, but please check the schedule below for specific dates.

Other Meetings of Council
Special Council meetings and Public Hearings are called by Council on an as needed basis. Agendas for these meetings are posted online and on our meeting boards in accordance with the Procedure Bylaw and the Community Charter.

Posting of Agendas
Regular Council and Committee of the Whole agendas are posted Wednesday afternoon immediately preceding the scheduled meeting. In the event of a statutory holiday, requiring a meeting to be hand on a Tuesday, agendas are posted on the immediately pre-ceeding Thursday.

Maxun lets you create custom robots which emulate user actions and extract data. A robot can perform any of the actions: Capture List, Capture Text or Capture Screenshot. Once a robot is created, it will keep extracting data for you without manual intervention

Screenshot 2024-10-23 222138

1. Robot Actions
Capture List: Useful to extract structured and bulk items from the website. Example: Scrape products from Amazon etc.
Capture Text: Useful to extract individual text content from the website.
Capture Screenshot: Get fullpage or visible section screenshots of the website.
2. BYOP
BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy) lets you connect external proxies to bypass anti-bot protection. Currently, the proxies are per user. Soon you'll be able to configure proxy per robot.

Features
✨ Extract Data With No-Code
✨ Handle Pagination & Scrolling
✨ Run Robots On A Specific Schedule
✨ Turn Websites to APIs
✨ Turn Websites to Spreadsheets
✨ Adapt To Website Layout Changes (coming soon)

+++ A lot of amazing things soon!
Cloud
We offer a managed cloud version to run Maxun without having to manage the infrastructure and extract data at scale. Maxun cloud also deals with anti-bot detection, huge proxy network with automatic proxy rotation, and CAPTCHA solving. If this interests you, join the cloud waitlist as we launch soon.
